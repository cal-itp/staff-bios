# Tiffany Chu

## Title / Company 
Caltrans, Data Scientist (Research Data Specialist III) based out of Los Angeles, CA.

## Contact Preference
Slack messages or simply tagging me in a GitHub issue / PR. Emails preferable for long, detailed content. Please invite both my DOT and Cal-ITP Gmail to meetings. 

I am off every other Monday.

## Who am I?

### Non-work

I'm an [ISTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) and Ennegram [Type 5](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-5). 

Outside, I like short hikes, gardening, and noticing weeds and butterflies and other critters. 

Inside, I like being a couch potato, watching many shows on too many streaming platforms, and cleaning (I am limited only by the battery charge of the Dyson).

### Work

I worked in research at an [education policy center](https://caldercenter.org), in the private sector at Cambridge Systematics, and in the public sector (LA Metro, City of LA, Caltrans). It was all data-related but not always transportation or transit related. The projects ranged from long multi-year projects (research) to projects with short turnarounds (private sector). 

In the end, I like medium-range projects, working in the agency that owns its own data, with stakeholders that posed research questions with a little more heft, with those questions tied to clearer operational / planning objectives. 

I like efficient processes, but with a good dose of practicality. Data work combines the challenge of sitting with a big picture research question, breaking it down into discrete steps, all while being extremely detailed and meticulous.

## Goals
### Learning goals
How to scale / build up a data team from the inception. Better tools for analysis, reproducibility, and scalability. Creating easy-to-access deliverables for stakeholders. SQL.

### Career goals
How to be a better mentor and teacher to analysts starting out in analytics.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
Brainstorm. Python / Jupyter Notebooks. Iterate. 

I often write, rewrite, revisit, refine, and iterate on my own code. If you need help with that process, I'm happy to brainstorm.

## How to support me as we work together
With analytics work, I prefer heads-down, focused time. If we have brainstorming sessions and I'm bringing the questions, I prefer having some notice so I can prepare my list of clarification questions and get it all answered at once. If we have brainstorming sessions and you have questions, I don't mind answering things off-the-cuff.

Some meetings, I prefer cameras off, especially in bigger meetings. Cameras on sometimes makes me feel more self-conscious!


## How to support me as a person
Break the ice for me! 

I'm a background lurker, and can be a reluctant facilitator. If I accidentally let you sit in uncomfortable silence, it's not intentional...I have an above-average tolerance for silence, so you can help me by posing questions or breaking the ice with small talk!


## Ways of working together
I'm pretty direct and to the point, which people mistake for being aloof, but it's because I'm more comfortable talking to just a couple of people at once. 

I'm open to feedback of revisiting why we do things and changing meetings so it's useful and efficient still. My pet peeve is keeping standing meetings or longer meetings on when they are no longer useful. 

If something isn't working, I want to know, so we can remediate it. This goes for workflows / processes / barriers / pain points / learning curves / stuff that can be automated, etc.

I like understanding the trade-offs between choices. More often than not, I'll pick a practical option that gets most of the way there with medium effort, and iterate to switch out portions later. If someone is asking me to choose between a couple options, I will often say I don't know, and ask questions to try and understand the pros/cons. Once our tools / workflow norms are set, I'll try and understand their boundaries (when to use, when not to use, what hack-y things to use in an edge case, etc).


## Teamwork preferences

Of necessity, I have had to grow into a facilitator role, albeit, reluctant facilitator. I still need a push to speak in bigger meetings (not 1-1 meetings). I find it easier when a question is posed and everyone can answer.


## Feedback preferences

Verbally or in writing. I like having something to reference later, so if you're giving feedback verbally, I'll likely pause and take notes on the side. 

I like having actionable feedback that gives me a chance to iterate.
