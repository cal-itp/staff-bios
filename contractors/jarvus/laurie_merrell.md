# Laurie Merrell

## Title / Company
I am Analytics Engineer with Jarvus. I work on the Data Services team, primarily on the GTFS data pipelines (schedule and realtime). I am based in ✶✶Chicago✶✶.

## Contact Preference
I usually prefer Slack. My working hours are usually 8am-5pm Central Time (6am-3pm Pacific.)

## Who am I?

### Non-work
Outside of work, I am on the board of [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/), where I am currently (August 2022) working on a GTFS-related project about "ghost buses". I am a local (Chicago) news enthusiast and enjoy biking, walking my dog, and spending time with my family. I'm an INTJ. 

### Work
I got my Master's degree in Analytics in 2020 after working for a while in software quality assurance and higher education administration. I got into transit/urban planning while I was getting my Master's, and my last job (between school and starting at Jarvus / Cal-ITP in 2022) also involved working with GTFS.

## Goals
### Learning goals
I like learning data engineering skills and tools.

### Career goals
Generally, working on public interest technology.

## You can lean on me to …
Answer questions about GTFS in general and our data pipeline in particular! I really enjoy helping people make sense of the data warehouse, please don't be shy to ask me anything. 

## How to support me as we work together
I can have a hard time maintaining boundaries around one task and tend to want to jump on every incoming request. You can help me by being very clear about the priority of your requests, especially if they are not urgent.

I tend to answer questions with a lot of detail, because that's how I like to learn (with abundant context). If it's too much / you want a short answer, please just let me know!

## Ways of working together
I really like having a meeting agenda doc available that people can add to in advance and clearly documenting follow-up items from the meeting.

## Technical preferences
I tend to use Python and SQL/dbt. I have experience working with Jupyter Notebooks and R, but haven't used them as much on Cal-ITP.

## Feedback preferences
I prefer to receive feedback in writing, in a one on one (rather than public) setting.
