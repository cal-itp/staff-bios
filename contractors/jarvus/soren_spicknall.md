# Soren Spicknall

## Title / Company 
I'm a Senior Data Engineer at Jarvus.


## Contact Preference
Slack is usually the best place to get in contact!

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I live in Chicago, a city that I care deeply about and don't intend to ever leave. [I am a photographer of architecture and the built environment](https://spicknall.us/), using documentary imagery as a jumping-off point for storytelling about individual stewardship of space and broader patterns of investment and disinvestment. I also help run [a neighborhood art gallery](https://blockhousegallery.square.site/), I'm a keeper of information about [the coffee shops of Chicago's south side](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=18b9uhyH_1C6SRk4byD2WnPSrN5UW6BJH&ll=41.79418010005153%2C-87.71611668992774&z=11), and I spend too much money on headphones and related personal audio gear.

### Work
I came up professionally in Chicago's civic tech scene, centered on the vibrant interdisciplinary volunteer community of [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/). I moved between data science, data engineering, and data governance in different work roles, including time on a hybrid civic engagement/civic innovation team at Microsoft, an early-stage startup focused on ethical data analysis for small business clients, some independent consulting for local government and nonprofit clients, and eventually several years in political tech at [The Movement Cooperative](https://movementcooperative.org/) (TMC). I come to Cal-ITP after having led TMC's data engineering work just prior.

## Goals
### Learning goals
Cal-ITP is structurally different than other projects I've been involved in before - I want to learn more about the linkages between all the organizations, funding sources, and all of that good stuff. I don't live in California, so it'll be fascinating just to learn more about the agencies, jurisdictions, governing legislation...

### Career goals
The last several years, I've come to focus more on data engineering than on my previous data science or data governance work. I want to deepen my understanding of emerging best practices and tools in data engineering, especially as it relates to the sectors I've always worked in - GovTech, nonprofit tech, and political tech. I don't have a strong preference between personal career evolution in the direction of people management vs. individual contributorship, but I do deeply value continuing to do work on interdisciplinary teams and multifaceted projects.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
...help navigate stacktraces to find root cause of a bug, work with you to resolve CI/CD issues or containerization issues that are baffling on the surface, and weigh in on design decisions for Python scripts.

## How to support me as we work together
I'm less experienced with some of the tools that are intrinsic to Cal-ITP data pipelines, like Airflow and dbt, than with classic containerized Python scripts. I have the basics down, but I might need patience and support for advanced tasks. I benefit from folks around me pointing out anti-patterns where they arise, providing detailed pull request feedback, and working collaboratively from our distinct but overlapping skillsets and experiences to find a forward path.

More broadly than engineering decisions alone, I deeply value understanding the constraints that others are working with, where decisions flow from, and which levers are set vs. which are movable. I do my best work when I have organizational context for why that work is happening and have a stake in the pieces that are mine or my team's.

## How to support me as a person
My spouse has complex health issues, so I may occasionally need to take time off without much advance notice in order to accomodate rapidly scheduled medical appointments. I am also a stickler for regular working hours - you will not be able to reach me outside of them.

## Ways of working together
On technical teams, I think making space for team-wide level-setting is super important. Not everybody needs to work exactly the same way as each other, but we should endeavor to have a shared understanding of which tools are right for the tasks at hand, including down to relatively granular details like specific Python packages or functions are better fit for a certain task than others. That extends to learning entirely new tools, too - the world of data is always evolving, and we should seek to be able to assess and evolve tools or practices when desirable from a shared place of knowledge.

## Teamwork preferences
I'm fairly outspoken in meetings when we're talking about things I feel experienced or comfortable with, but I can end up rambling off track a little bit. I invite anybody and everybody to intervene to keep me on topic if that ever happens.

## Technical preferences
I will almsot always hedge my preferences - I don't want to be parochial about the tools I use, and I want to keep an eye toward tools that are new to me that could improve my work - but I traditionally have enjoyed working with Python because it's versatile across subfields. Data scientists, web developers, data engineers, etc. all use it, which can ease the process of translating what's happening behind the scenes and guiding coworkers across domains. I also am a heavy VS Code user, for similar reasons: it works with pretty much everything and is highly extensible, so I can pretty much always rely on being able to stay in the same IDE for all my work.

## Feedback preferences
It's helpful for me to receive feedback, especially constructive feedback, in a format that points to specific examples of my patterns or behaviors to interrupt or improve upon. I don't have a strong preference between written feedback or spoken feedback, but in either venue I'll likely respond initially with a simple acknowledgement and take some time to sit with it rather than cementing my reaction immediately. Positive feedback is always welcome - I particularly think that it's great when a team utilizes shared spaces like open Slack channels to shoutout coworkers or collaborators for successes or praise.
