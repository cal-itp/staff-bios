## Title / Company 
We're a big mash up of remote Caltrans staff and contractors/consultants, so help give your teammates some context. In what city are you based?

Caltrans Research Data Analyst. Based in the East Bay and in the Sierras.  

## Contact Preference
Slack is the easiest way to contact me. For calendar invites, my DOT email works best. 

## Who am I?

### Non-work
Outside of work, I love to hike and ski! Sometimes get talked into doing running races.  

### Work
Educational background in geography and transportation planning at UCLA (Go Bruins!). I have previously worked in transportation finance, specifically local option sales taxes in California with UCLA ITS, and most recently with Jarvus Innovations as a Data Analyst. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hoping to continue to learn to be a better data analyst to create more meaningful data analyses and learning data pipelining. Also excited to learn/improve coding languages especially SQL.

### Career goals
Continue with increasing access to transit and transit funding! Would love to be more policy focused using data to drive decisions. 

## Teamwork preferences
I enjoy working in teams but am programmed to default to working alone. Sometimes I need a push to speak up but prefer if I have some notice just so I am not put too much on the spot. 

## Feedback preferences
I appreciate any and all feedback. Even if it is tough. I prefer feedback in writing over video call or in-person, for constructive feedback but am open to all forms. It may take me a while to process it, so donâ€™t second guess whether it was too tough.

## Teamwork preferences
I sometimes revert to working in a silo but enjoy working in groups! Sometimes I need a push to speak up but prefer if I have some notice just so I am not put too much on the spot. 

## Feedback preferences
If possible, I prefer written feedback. Occassionally, I need some time to process feedback.
