# Julia Ma


## Title / Company


Caltrans, Data Analyst (Research Data Analyst II) based in South Bay Area.


## Contact Preference


I prefer Slack and email. I generally use email for more thorough responses.


## Who am I?


### Non-work


I love to cook and have tea/coffee, and dabble in games and arts/crafts. Feel free to ask for any "hole in the wall" restaurants that I've enjoyed!


### Work


I’ve previously worked for the Employment Development Department (EDD) working with employment statistics (especially [the Census Quarterly Workforce Indicators](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/doc/QWI_101.pdf)), and prior to that, consulting and teaching. My educational background is in statistics at UCLA (Go Bruins!), where I also assisted with psychiatric research. 

I’ve predominantly worked with R ([R Studio swag](https://swag.rstudio.com/) anyone?) over the course of my studies/career for data wrangling, visualization, and analysis; and have gotten aquainted with Tableau, SAS, SQL, and Python.


## Goals


### Learning goals


I’m currently learning more about working with geospatial data, how transit systems work, and Python/SQL. I’m also interested in learning to design and collect surveys, and more broadly user feedback.


### Career goals


I would like to work more with data pipelining/analysis/statistics with GTFS; and design surveys for data collection. I aim to become a domain expert in GTFS datasets to better serve the public and stakeholders.


### You can lean on me to


Help out with analytics, research, R, and exploring new datasets!


### How to support me as we work together


I can get "Zoom fatigue" and prefer cameras off during calls if possible. I also sometimes need a push to speak up, in larger groups.


### Ways of working together


I generally prefer having advanced notice or a brief agenda for technical meetings. I also enjoy using whiteboards for brainstorming and sharing screens during meetings for a visual.


### Feedback preferences


I appreciate feedback either 1-1 or in a small group settings, thank you for taking the time to help me improve and grow!
