# Julia Ma


## Title / Company


Caltrans, Data Analyst (Research Data Analyst II) currently based in South Bay Area.


## Contact Preference


I prefer Slack and email. I generally use email for more thorough responses.


## Who am I?


### Non-work


I love to cook and have tea/coffee, and dabble in games and arts/crafts! I’ve gotten into bouldering lately too. Feel free to ask for any "hole in the wall" restaurants that I've enjoyed!


### Work


I’ve previously worked for the Employment Development Department (EDD) working with employment statistics, and prior to that, consulting and teaching. My education background is in statistics at UCLA, where I also assisted with psychiatric research. I’ve been using R over the course of my studies/career, with data wrangling and analysis.


## Goals


### Learning goals


I’m learning more about working with geospatial data, how transit systems work, and Python/SQL. I’m also interested in designing and collecting surveys, and more broadly user feedback.


### Career goals


I’d like to work more with data pipelining, analysis, and more broadly increase visualization/report accessibility!
