# Amanda Ha

## Title / Company 
I am a data analyst for Caltrans, working primarily with grant-adjacent data. I'm based in San Francisco. 

## Contact Preference
Both Slack and email (please use my DOT email) work for me. My hours are 7:30-5:00. I am out every other Friday.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I am an INFJ, an Enneagram Type 4, and a vegetarian. I love working on craft/art projects, reading (my favorite book is *The Haunting of Hill House*), and cooking. I speak Cantonese with my family and I'm slowly attempting to learn Dutch, as it's my husband's native language.

### Work
My background is in the state government sector. Caltrans is third agency I've worked for. I am finally vested! I have always been a data analyst, but all my jobs have been quite different. Prior to Caltrans, I worked with unions to collect and publish their wage data, wrote press releases on labor market conditions, fielded questions about the Employment Devleopment Department's data from journalists (as an introvert, this was terrifying), worked with Bureau of Labor Statistics and Census Bureau data, and created Tableau dashboards. This position at Caltrans has been my most technical and research-oriented. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
Learning and improving in Python is my primary goal. Learning how to approach a research project. Eventually, I hope to become familiar with SQL. This is my first experience with transit data, so I want to immerse myself more in this world. 

### Career goals
I hope to continue doing this type of analytical-research work as an IC and growing my technical skills. 

## You can lean on me to
Help out with Tableau. 

## How to support me as a person
I am not the most comfortable with showing off my work, so I am in the process of pushing myself to speak up and showing my work. I feel put on the spot when someone calls me out for an opinion or to speak up, but I know that's just part of the job. I also take a lot of notes, so I'm often staring down at my notebook and scribbling furiously. 

## Feedback preferences
I value feedback a ton. I like knowing what can be improved, areas of analysis that should be added, and making sure I'm heading the right direction. I prefer getting feedback in writing because I like to reference it later but I don't mind video calls.
