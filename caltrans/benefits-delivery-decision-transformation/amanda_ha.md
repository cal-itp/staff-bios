# Amanda Ha

## Title / Company 
I am a data analyst for Caltrans, working primarily with grants-adjacent data. I'm based in San Francisco. 

## Contact Preference
Both Slack and email (please use my DOT email) work for me. My hours are 7:30-5:00. I am out every other Friday.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I am an INFJ and a vegetarian. I love working on craft/art projects, reading (my favorite book is *The Haunting of Hill House*), and cooking. I speak Cantonese with my family and I'm slowly attempting to learn Dutch, as it's my husband's native language.

### Work
My background is in the state government sector. Caltrans is third agency I've worked for. I am finally vested! I have always been a data analyst, but all my jobs have been quite different. Prior to Caltrans, I worked with unions to collect and publish their wage data, wrote press releases on labor market conditions, fielded questions about the Employment Devleopment Department's data from journalists (as an introvert, this was terrifying), and created Tableau dashboards. This position at Caltrans has been my most technical and research-oriented. 

My biggest strength is Tableau. I enjoy how it's quite a creative process to figure out how to present data in an aesthetically pleasing and enlightening way. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
Learning and improving in Python is my primary goal. Eventually, I hope to learn a bit of SQL.

### Career goals
I hope to continue doing this type of analytical-research work as an IC and growing my technical skills. 

## You can lean on me to â€¦
Help out with Tableau. 

## How to support me as a person
I am definitely more of a wallflower in group settings. I am not the best at showing off my work, so I am in the process of pushing myself to speak up and showing my work. 

## Feedback preferences
I value feedback a ton. I like knowing what can be improved, areas of analysis that should be added, and making sure I'm heading the right direction. I prefer getting feedback of all types in writing because I like to reference it later. However, I don't mind video calls.
