# Amanda Ha

## Title / Company 
I am a data analyst for Caltrans, working primarily with grants-adjacent data. I'm based in San Francisco. 

## Contact Preference
Both Slack and email work for me. My hours are 7:30-5:00. I am out every other Friday.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I am an INFJ and a vegetarian. I love working on craft/art projects, reading (my favorite book is *The Haunting of Hill House*), and cooking. I am also attempting to learn Dutch, as it's my husband's native language.

### Work
My background is in the state government sector. Caltrans is third agency I've worked for! I have always been a data analyst, but all my jobs have been quite different. Prior to Caltrans, I worked with unions to collect and publish their wage data, wrote press releases on labor market conditions, fielded questions from journalists on the behalf of the Employment Development Department (as an introvert, this was terrifying), and created Tableau dashboards. 

My biggest strength is Tableau. I enjoy how it's quite a creative process to figure out how to present data in an aesthetically pleasing and enlightening way. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
Learning and improving in Python is my primary goal. Eventually, I hope to learn a  bit of SQL.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
Help out with Tableau.

## Teamwork preferences
I dislike public speaking, so I am in the process of pushing myself to speak up and show off my work in group settings more often. I am much more at ease when I am just talking to one or two individuals. 

## Feedback preferences
I prefer getting feedback of all types in writing because I like to reference it later. However, I don't mind video calls.
