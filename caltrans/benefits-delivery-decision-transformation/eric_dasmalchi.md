# Name

## Title / Company 
Caltrans, Data Analyst (Research Data Analyst II) living in Palms, Los Angeles, CA.


## Contact Preference
Slack (post in channels if appropriate so others can chime in too!). Also available via email, calendar invites to my DOT address please. Always happy to jump on a quick voice call/Slack huddle if it would be helpful to hash something out synchronously.

Off every other Friday, and generally available 8-5 Pacific.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I'm an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) / Enneagram [Type 1](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-1).

I like to tinker with things -- especially if that means solving a practical problem in an interesting and efficient way, say with a [diy ebike mod](https://github.com/edasmalchi/qiroll-pedal-assist). I also like keeping old but useful items working, annoying my friends with eccentric media choices including [certain 80s music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDIYOiQUi2s), and the board game Go.

I used to be a competitive bike racer; being outdoors is still an important part of my identity but not with the same intensity. These days I'm more interested in easy, relaxed outdoor activities that balance a moderate level of physical exertion with time to unwind and contemplate. 

### Work/Education
I'm early in my career, but I've been passionate and engaged in all things California, transit, and planning for a long time. I started with a desire for autonomy as a teenager and followed that thread through a dual degree in Urban Studies / Japanese Language at UC Berkeley and a Masters in Urban Planning (Transportation Planning and Policy) at UCLA, where I found the transit data niche and first learned about Cal-ITP. After completing a pair [capstone project](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8c08844w) with [Natalie Amberg](https://github.com/cal-itp/staff-bios/blob/main/caltrans/benefits-delivery-decision-transformation/natalie_amberg.md) and graduating in June 2021, I first joined the project on the Jarvus Innovations team before accepting a position with Caltrans in August 2022.

## Goals
### Learning goals
I would like to learn how to better document what I'm working on and thinking about so that I'm transparent and giving my team better opportunities to support me. I'm also learning how to distill broad goals into specific components, user stories, and acceptance criteria to provide clarity to the broader team -- especially in my role around the Cal-ITP Reports site.

### Career goals
Become a trusted collaborator in delivering complex analyses that meet the moment as we urgently address key issues in transportation, climate, housing, and beyond.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
I absolutely love helping to solve puzzles and unblock my teammates on analysis tasks! If you're stuck on a coding problem or need another person to brainstorm how to translate a user story or vague statute into something actionable don't hesitate to reach out. I'm never too busy and enjoy the comraderie.

I'm also fairly knowledgaable about general transportation planning principles and processses, as well as GTFS data and how it is realized in our warehouse and tooling.

## How to support me as we work together
I often like to jump right in and tackle a problem, but that doesn't mean I always get it right the first time. You can help support me by nudging me to take a step back and consider other choices, or talk through why I decided on a specific process.

## How to support me as a person
I appreciate a quick check in at the start of meetings, especially if we haven't seen each other in a little while! I would love to hear a bit about your weekend/hobby/etc if you're comfortable sharing.

## Ways of working together

### Teamwork preferences
Always happy to offer an opinion when asked, and please do let me know if I'm taking up too much of the meeting. If I put you on the spot it's probably because I think the work you're doing is really cool but of course feel free to decline if it's unwelcome!

### Feedback preferences
I prefer getting feedback verbally, either 1:1 or in a small group setting. I appreciate opportunities to ask clarifying questions and brainstorm how to improve.
