# [Name]
Shweta Adhikari

## [Title / Company] 
I am a Research Data Analyst II at the Division of Data and Digital Services at Caltrans. Based in Sacramento


## Contact Preference
 Slack, Teams, Email, Text, Call 
 I am off every other Friday (B) and my regular hours are 8:5-30.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I am originally from Nepal and love mountains (no surprise)! I love to hike, go on treks and like to be around nature (one of the reasons for my move to West Coast). I am trained in Indian semi-classical dancing and I am an yoga enthusiast. 

### Work
Educational background in agriculture and economics. I went to University of Georgia for my grad school (Go Dawgs!). Previously worked for an engineering company HDR as a transportation economist. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
To become comfortable working with all kinds of data and major programming languages. I want to integrate my economics and statistical analysis background to data science and machine learning and work in the transportation policy sectors.

### Career goals
Want to become a specialist in transit and transportation data and work to impact the transportation policy sector.

## Ways of working together
I like being in a team work environment where I can learn and contribute at the same time. I am a very curious person but sometimes shy to ask questions but I am working on that. I am pushing myself to speak up more and contribute as needed. I do a decent job when it comes to taking notes so you can rely on me if you miss something during the meetings and need to go back.

## Feedback preferences
I appreciate any and all feedbacks (immediate the better as it will give me chance to improve right away). I prefer 1:1 feedbacks over video calls or in-person if feasible.
