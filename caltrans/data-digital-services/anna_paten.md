# Anna Paten

## Title / Company 
I am a Research Data Analyst II at the Caltrans Division of Data and Digital Services. I am based in Los Angeles.

## Contact Preference
Teams and DOT email. My regular hours are Monday through Friday, 8:30am-6pm, taking alternate Fridays off on a Friday A schedule.

## Who am I?

### Non-work
I live in East Hollywood, where I can be found cautiously pedalling about on a Metro Bike or sitting in hipster coffee shops. I also like reading sci-fi novels, being a transit nerd, and trying new vegan food! I'm usually pretty introverted, but I like to explore LA on transit to see more of the city, and I'm always looking for recommendations of new places to go. 

### Work
I graduated UCLA with a degree in Computer Science in June 2024, and was previously a software engineering intern at CleverCanary and a Data Fellow at the Shared-Use Mobility Center (SUMC). At CleverCanary, I contributed to the development of open data portals for a variety of academic and nonprofit clients, while at SUMC I contributed to creating a data-driven framework for evaluating transit stops with a mobility hub framework and to regulatory research focusing on micromobility. As an undergrad I worked on transit and micromobility accessibility research in Prof Tierra S. Bills' group at the UCLA Department of Civil Engineering, and completed internships with the City of Santa Cruz and LADOT. 

## Goals
### Learning goals
I'm super excited to learn more about data science and engineering, in particular data warehouses and SQL, which I've managed to avoid picking up until now! I'm also interested in learning more about new transit data standards sich as TIDES and TODS, since pretty much all of my experience so far has been with GTFS and GBFS.

### Career goals
I want to develop my skills as an analyst and to be able to contribute to projects helping to create a more sustainable and efficient transportation systme. In particular, I'm interested in further developing my skills working with a larger team of analysts and engineers, since I've mostly worked in small groups or individually thus far.

## You can lean on me to â€¦
I'm always happy to help talk about the best solution to a technical problem, or to try and diagnose why that one function just isn't doing what it *should* do. While I definitely won't know the best way to do something, I'll always do my best to help and can try to collaboratively find a good solution. I have some experience with Pandas, and spatial data libraries such as geopandas, shapely, libpysal (a very little bit). I'm also always happy to talk about non-technical problems and help however I can.

## How to support me as we work together
I have a tendency to dive a little too deep into the first way I think of to solve a problem, and then realize that I've just reinvented the wheel or written something really inefficient. Sometimes it can help if someone looks over my early work and make comments, or to provide suggestions for a completely different way of working on problems.

I also have had a tendency to let errors such as typos and improper documentation sneak into my PRs. If you're reviewing my work, I really appreciate it making sure these get caught! 

## How to support me as a person
While usually I'm alright at getting myself heard, sometimes I have days when I really try to fade into the background. When that happens I always appreciate it if peple check in or make sure I'm included, it really means a lot.

## Ways of working together

### Teamwork preferences
I'm happy to use Teams/Slack chats, GitHub issuesm and video calls to work together. I often find that I'm better at high-level brainstorming over calls/meetings and that text chat is better for thinking through technical problems, but I don't really mind! 

### Feedback preferences
I don't have a strong preference for how to receive feedback, and I'm always open to finding ways to improve. Sometimes I will ask a bunch of clarifying questions about feedback, just because I want to make sure I know the best way to go about fixing something!
